# BlazorServerSideDataGrid
A simple RTL Server Side Data Grid for Blazor.

My goal was to create the simplest datagrid possible for serverside Blazor which could be easily modified and also extended.
Unfortunately I found no RTL Blazor datagrid on the web or github, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to share.

The project is self explainatory, but for those who want to know this datagid has following futures:
- sorting
- filtering
- paging
- page size
- RTL
- busy indicator 
- is tested with 10,000,000 items

This project is based on
