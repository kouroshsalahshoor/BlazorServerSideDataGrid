# BlazorServerSideDataGrid
A simple RTL Server Side Data Grid for Blazor.

این یک جدول سرور ساید بلیزره که فارسی رو هم ساپورت میکنه

My goal was to create the simplest datagrid possible for serverside Blazor which could be easily modified and also extended.
Unfortunately I found no RTL Blazor datagrid on the web or github, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to create one and share.

The project is self explanatory, but for those who want to know this datagid has following futures:
- sorting
- filtering
- paging
- page size
- RTL (Bootstrap-rtl)
- busy indicator (BlazorPro.SpinKit)
- is tested with 10,000,000 items (longRunningOperation demo)

This project is based on

Special thanks and lots of respect to both of them.

I hope this will be the first Blazor project of many which will do other programmers job easier.
